# Michael Mullarkey's Resume

This is the repo for the resume I've created using the [vitae package](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae). The resume is the .pdf file inside the "resume_markdown" folder. The code used to create the resume is the .Rmd file inside the "resume_markdown" folder. 

Note: the included hyperlinks will not be visible/clickable if you only preview the PDF document. To make the links visible/clickable click "Download" on the preview page.
