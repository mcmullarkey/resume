# Michael Mullarkey's Resume

This is the repo for the resume I've created using the [vitae package](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae). My resume is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcmullarkey/resume/main/resume_markdown/resume_markdown.pdf), and the code used to create my resume is [here](https://github.com/mcmullarkey/resume/blob/main/resume_markdown/resume_markdown.Rmd). 

Note: the included hyperlinks will not be visible/clickable if you only preview the PDF document. To make the links visible/clickable click "Download" on the preview page.
